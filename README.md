# QtPieISA
This is a custom ISA implementation with a basic IDE to parse, complete and display the instructions throughout the various steps in hexidecimal format. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to build to project from source you must have the following installed:

```
cmake 3.16.3 (minimum)
Qt5
make 
c++14
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Either unzip the main file or git clone it from here. 
* Make a build directory within the folder.
* From within the build directory run cmake.
* Make the application using a make command.
* launch the application found in /apps/QtPieISA/build/

For example:

```
cd QtPieISA
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
./app/QtPieISA/QtPie

```
